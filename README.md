Change Windows Wallpapers Randomly based on Konachan board

If you like me, likes to have random wallpapers, but hates needing to download everytime, here it is.

It's based on Konachan and Unsplash image board right now, but I might add other options in the future

- Add the Minimum Size and Possible tags you want

- Choose after how many seconds the Wallpapers should change

- Run and minimize

It will be on tray icons, you can open again anytime and stop.

Have doubts on what tags or data to use? Look on the APIs original sites that I used:
