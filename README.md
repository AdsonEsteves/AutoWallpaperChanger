Change Windows Wallpapers Randomly based on Konachan board

If you like me, likes to have random wallpapers, but hates needing to download everytime, here it is.
It's based on Konachan image board right now, but I might add other options in the future

Add the Minimum Size
The Rating 
and Possible tags you want (look at Konachan tags)
Choose after how many seconds the Wallpapers should change
Run and minimize

It will be on tray icons, you can open again anytime and stop.
